- Preferably, you cannot work on any issue that is not assigned to you.
- In case you want to submit an improvement to an existing feature or section, we prefer that you create an issue, describing in details your improvement. This will help others to analyze your contribution.
- If you have anything else in mind, create an issue and please wait for it to be assigned to you. You can then start working on it and create a PR.
